Halcogen exported code for TMS570LC43xx MCU
===========================================

There is no HAL available from TI to download and include for TMS570
or hercules series per se, we have code generated by their tool Halcogen
fo this family if chips.

This directory contains code exported and adapted from that, and the
reason to include it here is simply due to licensing of the said code.

The modifications are mainly to make the code less verbose while still
mostly keeping it similar. The assembly portions in particular are
mostly as is.

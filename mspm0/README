The MSPM0 SDK provides peripheral drivers and hardware register access 
header files for the Texas Instruments MSPM0 SoCs.

The current version supported in Zephyr is 2.04.00.06

  https://www.ti.com/tool/MSPM0-SDK

The source files are directly copied from the /source/ti/driverlib/ and /source/ti/devices directories.

Drivers and applications that need functions from the MSPM0 DriverLib C-files
will need to add the appropriate select entries in their Kconfig files.
For example when functions from ``dl_uart.c`` are used, the following
entry should apear in driver's Kconfig file.

.. code-block:: none

	select CONFIG_USE_MSPM0_DL_UART

should be added to the Kconfig file.

 *  @brief      Digital to Analog Conversion (DAC) Output Driver
 *
 *  @anchor ti_drivers_DAC_Overview
 *  # Overview
 *
 *  The DAC driver allows you to manage a Digital to Analog peripheral via
 *  simple and portable APIs. This driver supports converting DAC codes
 *  into an analog voltage with varying degrees of precision (microvolts
 *  or millivolts) depending on the resolution of the DAC.
 *
 *  <hr>
 *  @anchor ti_drivers_DAC_Usage
 *  # Usage
 *
 *  This documentation provides a basic @ref ti_drivers_DAC_Synopsis
 *  "usage summary" and a set of @ref ti_drivers_DAC_Examples "examples"
 *  in the form of commented code fragments. Detailed descriptions of the
 *  APIs are provided in subsequent sections.
 *
 *  @anchor ti_drivers_DAC_Synopsis
 *  ## Synopsis
 *  @anchor ti_drivers_DAC_Synopsis_Code
 *  @code
 *  // Import DAC Driver definitions
 *  #include <ti/drivers/DAC.h>
 *
 *  // Define name for DAC channel index
 *  #define VREFERENCE_OUT  0
 *
 *  // One-time init of DAC driver
 *  DAC_init();
 *
 *  // Initialize optional DAC parameters
 *  DAC_Params params;
 *  DAC_Params_init(&params);
 *
 *  // Open DAC channels for usage
 *  DAC_Handle dacHandle = DAC_open(VREFERENCE_OUT, &params);

 *  // Enable the DAC channel
 *  DAC_enable(dacHandle);
 *
 *  // Output 800mV using the DAC
 *  DAC_setVoltage(dacHandle, 800000);
 *
 *  // Output a voltage using DAC codes
 *  DAC_setCode(dacHandle, 125);
 *
 *  // Disable the DAC channel
 *  DAC_disable(dacHandle);
 *
 *  // Close the DAC channel
 *  DAC_close(dacHandle);

 *
 *  @anchor ti_drivers_DAC_Examples_open
 *  ## Opening a DAC instance
 *
 *  @code
 *  DAC_Handle dac;
 *  DAC_Params params;
 *
 *  DAC_Params_init(&params);
 *
 *  dac = DAC_open(0, &params);
 *  if (dac == NULL) {
 *      // DAC_open() failed
 *      while (1) {}
 *  }
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  @anchor ti_drivers_DAC_Examples_reference
 *  ## Using DAC to set a reference voltage
 *
 *  To set a reference voltage first enable the DAC with DAC_enable()
 *  and then set the desired output voltage with DAC_setVoltage().
 *  The returned value can be used to check if the call was successful.
 *
 *  @code
 *  int_fast16_t res;
 *  uint32_t outputMicroVolts = 1500000;
 *
 *  DAC_enable(dac);
 *  res = DAC_setVoltage(dac, outputMicroVolts);
 *  if (res == DAC_STATUS_SUCCESS)
 *  {
 *      printf(outputMicroVolts);
 *  }
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  @anchor ti_drivers_DAC_Examples_code
 *  ## Using DAC to set a code
 *
 *  The following example shows how to set a DAC code. The use of DAC_setCode()
 *  instead of DAC_setVoltage() comes handy in scenarios such as outputting a
 *  data buffer at a particular time rate (e.g. waveform generation). Nevertheless,
 *  it's important to remember that DAC codes produce different output voltages
 *  depending on the selected voltage reference source.
 *
 *  @code
 *  int_fast16_t res;
 *  uint32_t outputCode = 127;
 *  DAC_enable(dac);
 *  res = DAC_setCode(dac, outputCode);
 *  if (res == DAC_STATUS_SUCCESS)
 *  {
 *      printf(outputCode);
 *  }
 *  @endcode
